Pre-Reading
i) Do you know about the kind personality of our beloved Rasool ( )
ii) Do you know who is the final Rasool ( )??
 
The life of our kind Rasool is the role-model for  all humanity till the 
Day of Judgment. Patience and kindness were the greatest virtues of 
our Holy Rasool ( ). He repeatedly advised his companions 
to be kind to all the lives around them, without any discrimination. 
The Holy Rasool ( ) was kind and affectionate not only 
to human beings but also to all creatures of the universe. For this very reason Allah Almighty was pleased to bestow upon him the 
title of ‘Benefactor of all the worlds.’ Once Holy Rasool (
) 
told his companions, “Allah Almighty will not be kind to him who 
is not kind to others”Whenever our kind Rasool ( ) used 
to come across any animal which was over-burdened or ill fed he would speak mildly to the owner and say “Fear Allah regarding 
these dumb animals. Ride them when they are in good condition and feed them when they are in good condition.” 
(Abu Dawood-2548)
Once the Holy Rasool ( )  was traveling with his companions. 
During their journey when they decided to have some rest under 
the shade of date palm trees, Rasool ( )

8entered in the bushes nearby which belonged to a man from 
Ansaar. Suddenly a camel came towards him weeping tenderly with its eyes welling with tears. When the camel reached Rasool  
(
) it began to groan and its eyes flowed with tears.  
Holy Rasool ( ) patted on its hump and the base of its head 
until the camel quieted down. Then, He ( ) asked “who is 
the owner of this camel?” a young man came forward and said “it 
is mine, O Messenger of Allah.” Rasool ( ) said “Do you not 
fear Allah with regard to this creature which He has placed in your possession? It has complained to me that you starve it and put it 
to extreme work.” 
(Abu Dawood-2549)  The young man understood the 
words of Rasool ( ) and then the Holy Rasool ( ) 
and his companions continued their journey. 
The traditions of Holy Rasool Hazrat Muhammad ( )  
reminds us that human kind was sent on this earth to be the 
custodian of Allah’s Almighty creation. Our kind Rasool ( ) 
was not just concerned about the physical health of animals but also their emotional conditions.
While-Reading

weeping tenderly ?

Post-Reading
what was did the birds do 
when the hatchling was 
removed from its nest ?
9Once the Holy Rasool ( ) went out on a journey along with 
some of his companions. While passing through, they came across 
a sparrow’s nest. There were hatchlings, resting in absence of their 
mother. A companion of the Rasool ( ) picked up one of 
the hatchling to inspect. All at once, few sparrows came crying and 
began to fly over his head, beating their wings in grief. The Holy 
Rasool ( ) inquired why the sparrows were circling over 
them. Companions told the Holy Rasool ( ) that a hatchling 
had been removed from its nest by one of us. The Holy Rasool  
( ) was greatly moved. He ( ) felt sorry for the 
poor little birds which were incapable of doing anything about it. Holy Rasool (
) at once asked his companion to put back 
the hatchling in its nest, which he did without any delay. Circling 
sparrows were relieved after this and the cry of all the birds was 
finally over. (Abu Dawood-2675)
We should learn and follow our kind Prophet ( ) and treat 
animals around us well. We should be considerate about their 
physical and emotional health and never harm them for sport.

Students' Learning Outcomes

Biography means an account of a person’s life written by someone 
else. Sometimes, you begin to like or admire a famous person about 
whom you have heard or read. Now you want to know more about 
that personality, so you will read their biography.
A biography tells the life story of a real person. Almost every famous 
person has a biography, written about him or her. Many biographies 
have the pictures of the person, too. The details in a   biography are often true. The events in a person’s life are told in the order in which 
they happened. Most biographies start by telling about the person as 
a child. Then a biography gives facts about the person’s later life. You learn why the person is 
famous.
Some people make the world a better place to live in. Some have 
great adventures. Others are best at what they do. Read this true 
story about a famous teacher named Annie Sullivan. Her student, 
Helen Keller, who became a famous American author.
Annie Sullivan was an American teacher best known for being teacher 
and a companion to Helen Keller. At the age of five Annie contracted 
trachoma, an eye disease, which can almost blindness. Annie received her education at Perkins school for the Blind, where she learned 
Braille. Braille is the system by which blind people read by feeling 
raised dots on a page. She also learned how to talk to people who could not hear or see. She could tap words very quickly on their 
hands to communicate. Soon after graduation, she became a teacher 
to Helen Keller.Pre-Reading

Captain and Mrs. Keller of Tuscumbia, Alabama, wanted a teacher for 
their little girl, Helen. Helen was six years old. She was blind and deaf. 
She could not speak. Before she was two years old, an illness took 
away her sight, hearing and speech. She lived in a world of darkness.
Annie Sullivan struggled to teach Helen but she never gave up on 
her. She began by spelling words into Helen’s hands. Helen did not 
understand what words were. She did not know that everything has a name. She did not know that words can be put into sentences. Annie 
taught Helen many things by touching and spelling them into Helen’s 
hand. Still Helen didn’t understand.
Annie thought of a way to help Helen. She took 
Helen to the outdoor water pump. Helen held 
a mug while water was pumped into it. The cold water spilled over Helen’s hand. Annie spelled water as this happened. Suddenly Helen’s 
face changed. She spelled water by herself many times. She pointed 
to the pump, then to the ground, and asked for names. Quickly Annie spelled these words.
Helen wanted to know the name of every object she touched. She 
learned thirty new words in a very short time. Annie was overjoyed. She knew that she had broken through the darkness at last.
She had given Helen a key to the world around her the key of language.
