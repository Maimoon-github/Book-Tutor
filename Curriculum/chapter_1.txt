WHILE-READING

The life of our kind Rasool is the role-model for all humanity till the Day of Judgment. Patience and kindness were the greatest virtues of our Holy Rasool ( ). He repeatedly advised his companions to be kind to all the lives around them, without any discrimination. The Holy Rasool ( ) was kind and affectionate not only to human beings but also to all creatures of the universe. For this very reason Allah Almighty was pleased to bestow upon him the title of ‘Benefactor of all the worlds.’ Once Holy Rasool ( ) told his companions, “Allah Almighty will not be kind to him who is not kind to others”Whenever our kind Rasool ( ) used to come across any animal which was over-burdened or ill fed he would speak mildly to the owner and say “Fear Allah regarding these dumb animals. Ride them when they are in good condition and feed them when they are in good condition.” (Abu Dawood-2548) Once the Holy Rasool ( ) was traveling with his companions. During their journey when they decided to have some rest under the shade of date palm trees, Rasool ( ) entered in the bushes nearby which belonged to a man from Ansaar. Suddenly a camel came towards him weeping tenderly with its eyes welling with tears. When the camel reached Rasool ( ) it began to groan and its eyes flowed with tears. Holy Rasool ( ) patted on its hump and the base of its head until the camel quieted down. Then, He ( ) asked “who is the owner of this camel?” a young man came forward and said “it is mine, O Messenger of Allah.” Rasool ( ) said “Do you not fear Allah with regard to this creature which He has placed in your possession? It has complained to me that you starve it and put it to extreme work.” (Abu Dawood-2549) The young man understood the words of Rasool ( ) and then the Holy Rasool ( ) and his companions continued their journey. The traditions of Holy Rasool Hazrat Muhammad ( ) reminds us that human kind was sent on this earth to be the custodian of Allah’s Almighty creation. Our kind Rasool ( ) was not just concerned about the physical health of animals but also their emotional conditions.
Once the Holy Rasool ( ) went out on a journey along with some of his companions. While passing through, they came across a sparrow’s nest. There were hatchlings, resting in absence of their mother. A companion of the Rasool ( ) picked up one of the hatchling to inspect. All at once, few sparrows came crying and began to fly over his head, beating their wings in grief. The Holy Rasool ( ) inquired why the sparrows were circling over them. Companions told the Holy Rasool ( ) that a hatchling had been removed from its nest by one of us. The Holy Rasool ( ) was greatly moved. He ( ) felt sorry for the poor little birds which were incapable of doing anything about it. Holy Rasool ( ) at once asked his companion to put back the hatchling in its nest, which he did without any delay. Circling sparrows were relieved after this and the cry of all the birds was finally over. (Abu Dawood-2675) We should learn and follow our kind Prophet ( ) and treat animals around us well. We should be considerate about their physical and emotional health and never harm them for sport.

POINTS TO PONDER

Diphthong: A diphthong is a combination of two vowel sounds or letters in a single syllable. The sound begins with one vowel and moves towards another e.g. boil, main, etc.

Personal and Possessive Pronouns: Personal Pronouns are used in place of names of people, places and things. e.g: ‘he’ 'she'/ ‘it’, / 'my' ‘you’. Possessive pronouns are used to express ownership over something e.g: mine, yours etc.

• Ask students to repeat after you with correct pronunciation and intonation.
• Encourage students to share more sentences having personal and possessive pronouns.
