## **4\. Necessary Python Libraries**

Here's a breakdown of useful Python libraries, categorized by their function:

### **4.1. For LLM Interaction**

* Local Ollama models `deepseek-coder:latest, deepseek-r1:1.5b, nomic-embed-text:latest, deepseek-r1:latest`

### **4.2. For Data Handling & NLP (Pre-processing/Analysis)**

* pandas: For structured data manipulation (e.g., loading curriculum data from CSV/Excel, managing student records).
* numpy: Fundamental for numerical operations, especially if you get into more complex data analysis or embeddings.
* spacy: A powerful library for Natural Language Processing. Excellent for tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and dependency parsing, which can help in understanding student queries.
* nltk (Natural Language Toolkit): Another comprehensive NLP library. Good for tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and basic text processing. Often used alongside spacy.
* scikit-learn: If you want to implement simple machine learning models for student classification or progress prediction (e.g., for basic student model updates or answer evaluation using features).

### **4.3. For Curriculum Parsing (if starting from raw files)**

* PyPDF2 (or pypdf): To extract text content from PDF documents.
* BeautifulSoup4 (and requests): If your curriculum content is sourced from web pages or HTML files. requests to fetch the page, BeautifulSoup4 to parse HTML.
* textract: A unified library that attempts to extract text from many different file types (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.), potentially simplifying your parsing logic.

### **4.4. For Agentic Frameworks (Optional but Recommended for Structure)**

* crewAI: A more recent framework for orchestrating roles, tasks, and tools to create autonomous AI agents. It's particularly good for defining distinct "agents" within your system (e.g., a "Curriculum Agent," a "Question Generation Agent," a "Feedback Agent") that collaborate.

### **4.5. For Local Storage / Database**

* sqlite3: Python's built-in SQLite library. Excellent for lightweight, file-based databases to store student models, curriculum metadata, and interaction history. No external server needed.

### **4.6. For Web Interface (if applicable)**

* Gradio: Another excellent library for building user interfaces for machine learning models quickly. Very easy to get a demo up and running.

By combining these ingredients and following a structured approach, you'll be well-equipped to develop an intelligent and adaptive agentic AI tutor. Good luck\!
